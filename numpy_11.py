basic_sigmoid(x) # you will see this give an error when you run it, because x is a vector.


# In fact, if $ x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ is a row vector then $np.exp(x)$ will apply the exponential function to every element of x. The output will thus be: $np.exp(x) = (e^{x_1}, e^{x_2}, ..., e^{x_n})$

x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(np.exp(x)) # result is (exp(1), exp(2), exp(3))


# Furthermore, if x is a vector, then a Python operation such as $s = x + 3$ or $s = \frac{1}{x}$ will output s as a vector of the same size as x.
